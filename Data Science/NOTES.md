# Notes on Data Science
> **Data Science**: a process of extrcting meaning from data, using statistical tools and programming, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, team work , and reporting.

## Key Concepts



From data collection -> cleaning -> EDA -> product development

##### 4V in Big Data
- Volume
- Variety
- Velocity
- Veracity


##### Data Analytic Thinking
Translate a business problem into a data problem
- Decisions based on discovering unknown things from data (Association mining)
- Decisions that repeat at scale

#### Data Cleaning
- Outliers
- Missing data
- Dates formatting
- Calculated fields


## Statistics in Data Science
### Distributions
##### Bin size in Histogram
Choose appropriate bin sizes is about averaging the data to make trends visible and average out noise. A good rule of thumb to determine the bin width is the **Freedman-Diaconis rule**.
##### Kernel density estimation
##### Measures of central tendency
- Arithmetic mean
- Geometric mean
- Median
- Mode

*Median* is  not overly influenced by values at the extremes.  
*Mean* measures the expected value of the distribution.

##### Measures of variation
- Range
- Interquartile range (IQR)
- Variance
- Standard deviation
- Skewness
- Kurtosis

*Variance*: ![Useful formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Var%28X%29%20%3D%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5BX%5E2%5D%20-%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5BX%5D%5E2)  
*Skewness* refers to the direction and degree of lop-sidedness in a distribution.  
*Kurtosis* measures the extent to which the observed variance happens due to occasional big variations, or frequent modest variations.

##### Distribution arithmetic

##### Correlation
correlation coefficient
R squared
P valueThe P-value is the probability that you would have found the current result
if the correlation coefficient were in fact zero (null hypothesis) [is the result statistically significant]
confidence interval
RMSE
